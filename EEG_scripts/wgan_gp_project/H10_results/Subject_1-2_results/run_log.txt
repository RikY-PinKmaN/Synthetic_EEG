Found 3 strategies with the top validation accuracy of 100.00%.
Using ERP similarity score as a tie-breaker...
  - Strategy (Run 2, Batch 3, Ratio 1.0): Accuracy=100.00, ERP Score=-0.0381
  - Strategy (Run 1, Batch 28, Ratio 0.5): Accuracy=100.00, ERP Score=-0.0388
  - Strategy (Run 1, Batch 28, Ratio 1.0): Accuracy=100.00, ERP Score=-0.0388

Selected best strategy: Run 2, Batch 3, Strategy: Augmented (100%) with a validation accuracy of 100.00%
This strategy will now be evaluated on the unseen test set.


--- Step 8: Final Evaluation of Best Strategies on Test Set ---
BEST SYNTHETIC-ONLY (Val Acc: 66.67%) -> REAL test accuracy: 66.67%
Retraining best model on combined Train+Validation data for final evaluation.
BEST OVERALL STRATEGY (Augmented (100%), Val Acc: 100.00%) -> REAL test accuracy: 81.82%
